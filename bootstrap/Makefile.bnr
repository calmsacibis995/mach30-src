# HISTORY
# $Log:	Makefile.bnr,v $
# Revision 2.2  93/05/10  17:44:18  rvb
# 	Revised for bsdss.
# 	[93/05/04  16:29:42  rvb]
# 
# Revision 2.14  93/02/04  13:03:02  mrt
# 	Removed the installation of bootstrap. This file is only
# 	used during a kernel build when it is found in export.
# 	[93/02/04            mrt]
# 
# Revision 2.13  93/02/04  10:55:30  mrt
# 	Made xstripping rule explicit again as it has been
# 	removed from osf.mach3.mk.
# 	[93/02/02            mrt]
# 
# Revision 2.12  93/02/01  08:37:49  danner
# 	Added -Dsun4c to Sun 4 CFLAGS (after the include of rules.mk).
# 	It is needed for now to get the right parameters for allocating
# 	the stack.
# 	[93/01/29            dlc]
# 
# Revision 2.11  93/01/24  13:54:45  danner
# 	Xstrip rule now implicit.
# 	[93/01/24            danner]
# 
# 	Updated for ODE make.
# 	[93/01/01            mrt]
