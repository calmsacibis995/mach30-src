 * HISTORY
 * $Log:	busses.h,v $
 * Revision 2.9  93/05/10  20:07:21  rvb
 * 	No more caddr_t.
 * 	[93/04/09            af]
 * 
 * Revision 2.8  93/01/14  17:15:13  danner
 * 	Added BUS_CTLR flag.  Use on machines that truly have bus
 * 	adaptors, and write a probe function for it.
 * 	This was the grand plan from the beginning, alpha now does it.
 * 	[92/11/30            af]
 * 
 * Revision 2.7  91/08/24  11:51:27  af
 * 	Mods to cope with the 386 PC/AT ISA bus.
 * 	[91/06/20            af]
 * 
 * Revision 2.7  91/06/19  11:46:25  rvb
 * 	File moved here from mips/PMAX since it tries to be generic;
 * 	it is used on the PMAX and the Vax3100.
 * 	[91/06/04            rvb]

 * Revision 2.5  91/02/05  17:47:09  mrt
 * 	Added author notices
 * 	[91/02/04  11:21:07  mrt]

/*
 *
 * This is mildly modeled after the Unibus on Vaxen,
 * one of the most complicated bus structures.
 * Therefore, let's hope this can be done once and forall.
 *
 * At the bottom level there is a "bus_device", which
 * might exist in isolation (e.g. a clock on the CPU
 * board) or be a standard component of an architecture
 * (e.g. the bitmap display on some workstations).
 *
 * Disk devices and communication lines support multiple
 * units, hence the "bus_driver" structure which is more
 * flexible and allows probing and dynamic configuration
 * of the number and type of attached devices.
 *
 * At the top level there is a "bus_ctlr" structure, used
 * in systems where the I/O bus(ses) are separate from
 * the memory bus(ses), and/or when memory boards can be
 * added to the main bus (and they must be config-ed
 * and/or can interrupt the processor for ECC errors).
 *
 * The autoconfiguration process typically starts at
 * the top level and walks down tables that are
 * defined either in a generic file or are specially
 * created by config(1).
