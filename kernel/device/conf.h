 * HISTORY
 * $Log:	conf.h,v $
 * Revision 2.6  93/05/17  16:23:23  rvb
 * 	Since map's return vm_offset_t's, we need a "nomap()" that does
 * 	so also, to keep the type system happy.
 * 	[93/05/17            rvb]
 * 
 * Revision 2.5  93/02/05  07:50:17  danner
 * 	The map function really returns a phys address.
 * 	[93/02/04  01:54:45  af]
 * 
 * Revision 2.4  91/08/28  11:11:12  jsb
 * 	Change block size entry to general device info entry.
 * 	[91/08/12  17:24:37  dlb]
 * 
 * 	Add block size entry.  Only needed for block_io devices.
 * 	[91/08/05  17:28:42  dlb]
 * 
 * Revision 2.3  91/05/14  15:39:57  mrt
 * 	Correcting copyright
 * 
 * Revision 2.2  91/02/05  17:08:10  mrt
 * 	Changed to new Mach copyright
 * 	[91/01/31  17:26:55  mrt]
 * 
 * Revision 2.1  89/08/03  15:26:07  rwd
 * Created.
 * 
 * 12-May-89  David Golub (dbg) at Carnegie-Mellon University
 *	Added indirect devices.
 *
 * 12-Apr-89  David Golub (dbg) at Carnegie-Mellon University
 *	Added port_death routine.
