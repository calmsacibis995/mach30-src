/*
 *	A msg-accepted request is made when MACH_SEND_NOTIFY is used
 *	to force a message to a send right.  The IE_BITS_MAREQUEST bit
 *	in an entry indicates the entry is blocked because MACH_SEND_NOTIFY
 *	has already been used to force a message.  The kmsg holds
 *	a pointer to the marequest; it is destroyed when the kmsg
 *	is received/destroyed.  (If the send right is destroyed,
 *	this just changes imar_name.  If the space is destroyed,
 *	the marequest is left unchanged.)
 *
 *	Locking considerations:  The imar_space field is read-only and
 *	points to the space which locks the imar_name field.  imar_soright
 *	is read-only.  Normally it is a non-null send-once right for
 *	the msg-accepted notification, but in compat mode it is null
 *	and the notification goes to the space's notify port.  Normally
 *	imar_name is non-null, but if the send right is destroyed then
 *	it is changed to be null.  imar_next is locked by a bucket lock;
 *	imar_name is read-only when the request is in a bucket.  (So lookups
 *	in the bucket can safely check imar_space and imar_name.)
 *	imar_space and imar_soright both hold references.
