 * HISTORY
 * $Log:	mach_port.defs,v $
 * Revision 2.6  92/01/14  16:45:25  rpd
 * 	Changed mach_port_{name,type}_array_t usages to remain compatible,
 * 	because the definition of the types changed incompatibly.
 * 	[92/01/13            rpd]
 * 
 * Revision 2.5  91/08/28  11:15:13  jsb
 * 	Added mach_port_set_seqno.  Moved mach_port_get_receive_status
 * 	to a new id, renaming the old call old_mach_port_get_receive_status.
 * 	[91/08/09            rpd]
 * 
 * Revision 2.4  91/05/14  16:54:47  mrt
 * 	Correcting copyright
 * 
 * Revision 2.3  91/02/05  17:33:31  mrt
 * 	Changed to new Mach copyright
 * 	[91/02/01  17:18:11  mrt]
 * 
 * Revision 2.2  90/06/02  14:58:25  rpd
 * 	Modified mach_port_get_receive_status to return
 * 	a status structure (mach_port_status_t).
 * 	Updated mach_port_set_qlimit comment.
 * 	[90/05/13            rpd]
 * 	Created for new IPC.
 * 	[90/03/26  23:45:32  rpd]
