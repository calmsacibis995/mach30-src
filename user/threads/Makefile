# HISTORY
# $Log:	Makefile,v $
# Revision 2.29  93/08/02  21:44:56  mrt
# 	Added LIB_LONG_NAMES for the mips and i386 since one of
# 	the .o names in the libthreads_p.a is too long.
# 	[93/06/13            mrt]
# 
# Revision 2.28  93/06/02  20:50:07  rvb
# 	Added definition of NOSTRIP.
# 	[93/06/02            mrt]
# 
# Revision 2.27  93/05/13  13:47:35  rvb
# 	".if <var> == string" requires string to be in double quotes.
# 
# Revision 2.26  93/05/11  15:06:02  rvb
# 	LIBRARIES_P only for mips and i386
# 
# Revision 2.25  93/05/11  09:48:35  rvb
# 	Removed -pg and -DGRPOF for mips and i386.  Added
# 	LIBRARIES_P instead. Now libthreads.a and libthreads_p.a
# 	will always get built and exported.
# 	[93/05/11            mrt]
# 
# Revision 2.24  93/05/10  17:51:13  rvb
# 	Handle -pg and -DGPROF just like libthreads does.
# 	[93/05/06            rvb]
# 	-DCTHREAD_DATA is now unnecessary.  It is effectively
# 	always true.
# 	[93/05/06            rvb]
# 
# Revision 2.23  93/01/24  13:27:10  danner
# 	Modified for ODE make
# 	[92/12/17            mrt]
# 
# Revision 2.21  92/05/22  18:38:31  jfriedl
# 	From Mike Kupfer <kupfer@sprite.Berkeley.EDU>:
# 	Enable CTHREAD_DATA for the kernel bootstrap program.
# 
# Revision 2.20  92/03/05  22:46:34  rpd
# 	Changed to use double-colon rules for top-level targets.
# 	[92/02/28            rpd]
# 
# Revision 2.19  92/01/23  15:22:53  rpd
# 	Revised for new Makefile organization.
# 	[92/01/16            rpd]
