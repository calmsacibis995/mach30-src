 * HISTORY
 * $Log:	mig_support.c,v $
 * Revision 2.8  93/01/24  13:27:14  danner
 * 	Corrrected include of mach/mach.h to mach.h
 * 	[93/01/16            mrt]
 * 
 * Revision 2.7  93/01/14  18:05:37  danner
 * 	Converted file to ANSI C.
 * 	Made argument to mig_init a void * for compatibility with
 * 	mig_init in libmach.
 * 	[92/12/18            pds]
 * 
 * Revision 2.6  91/05/14  17:57:41  mrt
 * 	Correcting copyright
 * 
 * Revision 2.5  91/02/14  14:20:30  mrt
 * 	Added new Mach copyright
 * 	[91/02/13  12:41:26  mrt]
 * 
 * Revision 2.4  90/08/07  14:31:41  rpd
 * 	Removed RCS keyword nonsense.
 * 
 * Revision 2.3  90/08/07  14:27:48  rpd
 * 	When we recycle the global reply port by giving it to the first
 * 	cthread, clear the global reply port.  This will take care of
 * 	someone accidently calling this twice.
 * 	[90/08/07            rwd]
 * 
 * Revision 2.2  90/06/02  15:14:04  rpd

 * 
 * Revision 2.1  89/08/03  17:09:50  rwd
 * Created.
 * 
 * 18-Jan-89  David Golub (dbg) at Carnegie-Mellon University
 *	Replaced task_data() by thread_reply().
 *
 *
 * 27-Aug-87  Eric Cooper (ecc) at Carnegie Mellon University
 *	Changed mig_support.c to avoid deadlock that can occur
 *	if tracing is turned on	during calls to mig_get_reply_port().
 *
 * 10-Aug-87  Eric Cooper (ecc) at Carnegie Mellon University
 *	Changed mig_support.c to use MACH_CALL.
 *	Changed "is_init" to "multithreaded" and reversed its sense.
 *
 * 30-Jul-87  Mary Thompson (mrt) at Carnegie Mellon University
 *	Created.
